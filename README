Drachen -- Delta-Rle ArCHive ENcoding
=====================================

Overview
--------
Drachen is a library for quickly compressing very similar frames of equal-sized
data. It aims to have good speed and to attain very high compression ratios for
data which are sufficiently redundant.

Dependencies
------------
You only need your C compiler and make to build libdrachen; it has no
non-standard dependencies.

If you are building from a Git clone, you will also need Autotools.

Building and Installing
-----------------------
First, if you are building from a Git clone (there is no file named
``configure''), run the following:
----------------
  mkdir -p m4
  autoreconf -i
----------------

Then, to build, run
----------------
  ./configure
  make
----------------
(You may want to pass `--prefix=/usr` to configure).

To install, run the following as root (su/sudo):
----------------
  make install
----------------
