.SH NAME
libdrachen \- manual page for libdrachen 0.0.1
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B drachencode
\fI-e \fR[\fI-fvtwD\fR] [\fIimage-opts\fR] [\fI-b blk-sz\fR] \fI-o outfile infiles\fR...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.IP
drachencode \fB\-d\fR [\-fvtwD] [\-n format] [infile]
.PP
Encodes or decodes libdrachen files from or into individual named files.
.PP
All options are listed below.
\fB\-b\fR, \fB\-\-block\-size\fR=\fIsize\fR
.IP
Sets the block size for encoding, in bytes.
Block size does not significantly affect encoding speed (except for
extreme values). Adjusting the block size from the default may give
better compression ratios.
.PP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-decode\fR
.IP
Perform decoding. This option is mutually exclusive with \fB\-\-encode\fR;
exactly one of the two must be specified.
.PP
\fB\-D\fR, \fB\-\-dry\-run\fR
.IP
Do everything but file writing.
.PP
\fB\-e\fR, \fB\-\-encode\fR
.IP
Perform encoding. This option is mutually exclusive with \fB\-\-decode\fR;
exactly one of the two must be specified.
.PP
\fB\-f\fR, \fB\-\-force\fR
.IP
On decoding, allow overwriting of files. On encoding, allow implicitly
writing to standard output (this makes \fB\-\-output\fR optional).
.PP
\fB\-h\fR, \-?, \fB\-\-help\fR
.IP
Print this help message and exit.
.PP
\fB\-H\fR, \fB\-\-img\-block\-height\fR=\fIheight\fR
\fB\-W\fR, \fB\-\-img\-block\-width\fR=\fIwidth\fR
\fB\-O\fR, \fB\-\-img\-offset\fR=\fIoffset\fR
\fB\-C\fR, \fB\-\-img\-num\-cols\fR=\fIncols\fR
\fB\-X\fR, \fB\-\-img\-num\-components\fR=\fIncomps\fR
\fB\-R\fR, \fB\-\-img\-num\-rows\fR=\fInrows\fR
.IP
On encoding, reorder the input bytes to be optimal for an image which
is ncols pixels wide and nrows pixels high, whose pixels are ncomps
bytes wide, and whose first pixel is located at byte offset offset.
Bytes are rearranged so that each colour component is in a run by
itself, and pixels within blocks of size width by height are in
contiguous runs. Width and height should (but do not have to be)
evenly divisible into ncols and nrows, respectively. The overall
frame size must be greater than (offset+ncomps*nrows*ncols) bytes.
If no \fB\-\-block\-size\fR is given, block size is implicitly set to
(width/4) bytes.
If no \fB\-\-img\-offset\fR is given, zero is assumed. If \fB\-\-img\-num\-components\fR
is not given, one is assumed.
Either all or none of these options must be given, except for
\fB\-\-img\-offset\fR and \fB\-\-img\-num\-components\fR, which are always optional.
.PP
\fB\-w\fR, \fB\-\-no\-warnings\fR
.IP
Suppress any warnings that may be issued.
.PP
\fB\-n\fR, \fB\-\-numeric\-output\-fmt\fR=\fIformat\fR
.IP
Instead of using files embedded in the archive on decoding, instead
use format (a printf\-compatible string which will receive exactly one
integer argument) to derive filenames from a zero\-based frame index.
.PP
\fB\-o\fR, \fB\-\-output\fR=\fIoutfile\fR
.IP
On encoding, write to outfile instead of standard output. The name
"\-" means to use standard output, even if \fB\-\-force\fR was not given.
.PP
\fB\-t\fR, \fB\-\-show\-timing\fR
.IP
Show timing and speed statistics.
.PP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
.IP
Print more messages. Each use of this option increases the verbosity.
.PP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
.IP
Print version number and exit.
.PP
\fB\-z\fR, \fB\-\-zero\-frames\fR
.IP
On decoding, pretend the previous frame, starting at img\-offset, is
entirely zero. This has interesting effects for video.
